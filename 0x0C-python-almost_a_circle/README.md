## Covered Python Concepts

### Core Python Fundamentals
- **Import**: Usage of `import` statements to include external modules and packages.
- **Exceptions**: Handling errors and exceptional cases using `try`, `except`, and `raise`.
- **Class**: Implementation of classes as blueprints for creating objects with shared attributes and behaviors.
- **Private Attribute**: Demonstrating the use of private attributes for encapsulation and data hiding.
- **Getter/Setter**: Utilizing getters and setters for controlled access to class attributes.

### Class Methods and Inheritance
- **Class Method**: Usage of class methods to perform operations at the class level.
- **Static Method**: Implementation of static methods to encapsulate utility functions within a class.
- **Inheritance**: Demonstrating inheritance for sharing attributes and behaviors between classes.

### File Operations and Unit Testing
- **Read/Write File**: Utilization of file handling for reading and writing data to external files.
- **Unittest**: Creation of unit tests to verify the correctness of the implemented functionality.

### Advanced Python Features
- **Args and Kwargs**: Understanding and utilizing `*args` and `**kwargs` for handling variable arguments in functions and methods.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Handling serialization and deserialization of objects and data.
- **JSON**: Use of the JSON format for data representation and interchanging.

## Functionality Showcased
This project exhibits the following functionalities:
- Creation and manipulation of geometric shapes (Rectangles and Squares).
- Serialization and deserialization of instances using JSON.
- Saving instances to files and loading them back.

## Directory Structure
- `models/`: Contains the implementation of classes for Rectangles and Squares and methods for serialization and deserialization.
- `n-main.py`: Example usage demonstrating the functionalities of the model classes.
